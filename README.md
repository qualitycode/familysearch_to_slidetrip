# Familysearch to slidetrip

Or should I say slidetrip to familysearch?  Whatever.  This is the first of many projects to enhance slidetrip.com.

## What is slidetrip.com?

It is smart software that will create movies from your family history, with audio narratives, relevant pictures, a 3D earth, web page & book.

## To Do List:

 1. Hook up the existing slidetrip.com slideshow generator to
    familysearch.org.  Currently slidetrip uses
    [GEDCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM) files to generate
    online slideshows. These shows include audio, images, video, plus
    virtual trips to your ancestral lands via Google Earth or Google
    Maps.  Slidetrip converts the gedcom files into xml files.  People
    don't like creating GEDCOM files from their genealogy software.  So
    we need to use the api from familysearch.org as the source.  This
    makes it easier to use slidetrip.
 2. After we get slidetrip running with familysearch, we need to
    re-write slidetrip.  It needs to be converted from Adobe Flash to
    javascript.
 3. Add collaboration.
 4. Tools to collaborate to create color picture books from photos and
    stories.
 5. There are other cool parts of this project, which will be documented
    later.

We need programmers, graphic designers, genealogy mentors. Programmers, we are using the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node.js, javascript, etc.)
